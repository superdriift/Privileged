We fell in love with it's beauty and what it stands for. The various gemstone colors and hand carved designs are undeniably beautiful, and no 2 pieces are the same.  Over 20 years ago, After buying a few pieces we built and maintained a relationship with a small Jade jeweler and eventually purchased their collection. All of our Jade is sourced from south east Asia and have been authenticated. </h4>
